/*
Build a model for the parallel composition of two transition systems modelling the behaviour 
of traffic lights at two intersection roads.

Each traffic light can show either red or green. Both traffic lights synchronize by means of
 the actions A and B that indicate the change of light, 
 e.g., action A indicates that traffic light 1 transitions from red to green, and 
 that traffic light two transitions from green to red.

Check whether it is possible for the traffic lights to deadlock.

Use the variable names traffic_light1, traffic_light2, green1, red1, green2, red2.
