/*
We are given three (primitive) processes P1,P2, and P3 with shared integer variable x. The program of each process is as follows:

for x = 1,...,10 do
 LOAD(x);
 INC(x);
 STORE(x);
od

That is, each process executes ten times the assignment x:=x+1.

The assignment x := x+1 is realized using the three actions LOAD(x), INC(x) and STORE(x). Consider now the parallel program:

x := 0;
P1 || P2 || P3

Build a model of the parallel program. Write a property that checks if P has an execution that halts with the terminal value x=2.

Use the variable name x
