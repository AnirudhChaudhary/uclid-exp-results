Model a traffic light with the usual three phases "red", "green", and "yellow".

Add assertions to check the safety property that every red phase is immediately preceded by a yellow phase. You may add auxiliary variables.

Use the variable names red, green, yellow.


module TrafficLight {
  var prev_red: boolean;
  var red: boolean;
  var green: boolean;
  var yellow: boolean;

  next {
    prev_red' = red; 
    red' = yellow; 
    yellow' = green; 
    green' = prev_red; 

  }
}
