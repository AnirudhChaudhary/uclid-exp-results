Regard the program graph for the instructions A and B of the parallel program below, where action A is on the left of the ||| and action B is on the right:

x:=2*x ||| x:=x+1

We assume that initially x=3.

Build a model of this transition system, with a shared variable and two actions that act on the same shared variable x.

Use the variable name x.

module Program {
  var A: boolean;
  var x: integer;

  init {
    x = 3;

  }
  next {
    x' = (if (A) then (x * 2) else (x + 1));

  }
}
