Model an event counter that is used in a weather station to count the number of times that a temperature rises above some threshold.

Use the variable names temp and count.


module EventCounter {
  var temp: real;
  var count: integer;

  init {
    temp = 0.0; 
    count = 0; 

  }
  next {
    if (temp > 50.0) {
      count' = (count + 1); 
    }

  }
}
