Build a model of a concurrent program, in which three processes, Inc, Dec, and Reset, cooperate. They operate on the shared integer variable x with arbitrary initial value that can be accessed (i.e., read), and modified (i.e., written) by each of the individual processes.

The processes are:
proc Inc = while true do if x<200 then x:=x+1 fi od
proc Dec = while true do if x>0 then x:= xâˆ’1 fi od
proc Reset = while true do if x=200 then x:=0 fi od

Process Inc increments x if its value is smaller than 200, Dec decrements x if its value is at least 1, and Reset resets x once it has reached the value 200. They all do so repetitively.

Write an invariant that checks if the value of x is always between (and including) 0 and 200.

Use the variable name x.


module Module {
  var Dec: boolean;
  var Inc: boolean;
  var Reset: boolean;
  var x: integer;

  init {
    x = 100; 

  }
  next {
    Inc' = (x < 200); 
    Dec' = (x > 0); 
    Reset' = (x == 200); 

  }
  invariant x_inv : ((x >= 0) && (x <= 200));
}
